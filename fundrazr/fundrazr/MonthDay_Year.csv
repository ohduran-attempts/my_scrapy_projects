"This is a unique open collaboration between theTwinsUK team at King's College LondonandThe
      American Gut Project (AGP)to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut.Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease.This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?'We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe.The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome.What does it entail?First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within three weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results.After you have returned your sample to us, the samples will be
  processed and analysed by the Knight Lab at University of California,
  San Diego and you will be provided with a list of the major groups of
  bacteria in your sample and the proportions in which they are found.
  We estimate that this will take around 3 months from the time your
  sample is scanned into our lab (but possibly longer) and once we
  provide you with your results, you will be able to see how your
  bacterial community compares to others in the study. From the diet and
  lifestyle information that you provide, we will also be able to show
  you how your results compare to other people who are within the same
  diet and lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to
  them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you
  have experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your
  bacterial profile is different).Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information/advice related to your microbiome profile.How will my sample be used?The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample.We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"WHAT IS ENCHROMA?Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy.Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take

"Hi!I'm Zara. Zara Sivčević. I'm 11 and half years old. I don't walk … I
  have cerebral palsy - hypotonic syndrom. I was born in 28th week of my
  mom's pregnancy.Prematurely born – prematura nata …Unfinished,undeveloped,with a lot of deformities. Unhealthy …Based on Appgar's scale for newborns, I was ZERO ( 0 ) . I wasn't
  given any chances to survive. The doctors told my mum and dad I wasn't
  going to survive. They told them, even though I survive, I was going
  to be a plant . They were saying I was going to vegetate...I was breathing, I was loved .. Love used to guide me day by day . I
  had my right hip twisted and I underwent surgery. My feet were in
  equinovarus and they underwent surgeries for three times.I had dioprty –11 on both of my eyes and a difficult shape of
  strabismus . I also underwent surgery for my left eye ..I'm from Bosnia and Herzegovina. My mom and I moved to Slovenia back
  in 2008., when I was two years old. Now I'm 4th grade of primary
  school in Center for education,rehabilitation and orientation. Now I
  ride an orthopedic bicycle,and I also swim and ride ..I used to drag my body on my elbows. Now I can sit down and lift up
  my body on my knees. By using orthoses and walker, I can even stand up.Starting January 08th 2018 year, I got an appointment for therapies
  of Neurorehabilitation robotics in Zagreb. Eight weeks of intensive
  six-houred everyday therapies. All those therapies could help me on
  getting a steadily standing, balance and walking.Therapies cost 12.558,00 € . My parents don't have that money,
  because they have been paying my treatments and rehabilitation in
  Slovenia for nine years : five surgeries,buying of orthopedic
  apparatures, therapies and our living in Ljubljana.I'm sincerely asking you to help me to get this money, so I can start
  with my therapies !!I think it won't harm your finances . I suggest that you pay in only
  1 €, and then you ask your friends to do the same. Wouldn't it be
  fantastic if if twelve thousand five hundred and fifty eight people
  pay in only 1 € each for Zara Sivčević ? For me !! And then,starting
  by January 08th, I could begin with my therapies.May that be your New Year's or Christmas wish for somebody you don't
  know, but what you do know is that that person has an enormous wish to
  walk. To step up in the life on her own ..For me..For Zara !!I can assure you that you'll start going towards the stars together
  with me. Because only those who have an sincere desire in their
  hearts, a wish to spread love and well being around them. Only they
  know the path towards the stars !! Give me your hand and let's start

"In July 2014, 2-year-old Eve McGonigle was diagnosed with an
  extremely rare and life-threatening brain tumour called Ependymoma.
  After weeks of mis-diagnosis, Eve was extremely ill, struggling to
  walk, talk or even eat. The life was sucked out of her and it was
  agonising to see the once mischevious and adorable toddler struggling
  to survive. Eve's condition drastically deteriorated and after a visit
  to the Borders General Hospital was rushed to Edinburgh's Sick Kids
  for emergency treatment after a brain scan determined the unthinkable.
  This was truly devastating and soul destroying for Eve's family who
  could only rally around and pray for a miracle, whilst Eve lay almost
  unrecognisable in a ward bursting with other young children fighting
  for their lives.Upon arriving at the hospital, Eve was taken in and cared for by the
  magical staff and nurses of Ward 7. The procedures and life-saving
  treatment that Eve required were terrifying for both Eve and her
  family, however the miraculous nurses and medical staff were
  constantly on hand 24 hours a day to help with their calming and
  loving nature, somehow helping to make the six week stint in a stark
  hospital bed bearable. These people dedicate their lives to ensure the
  young children that enter the ward have the very best chance of making
  it out in full health, so we want to give something back.EVEolution has been set up to help the staff and patients of Ward 7
  to improve the facilities on the ward to allow children fighting this
  deadly disease and their families find some sort of comfort and solace

  grateful knowing that with your generous support we have made a
  difference to help future children like Eve and their families having

"OUR GAME PLANWe are looking into effective alternative treatments to try to
    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer,plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time.The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon.Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally.I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid.This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces.ABOUT MY MOMFrom an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again.My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy.She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill.She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us.LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUEIf you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from

"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work

"Hello,We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage.Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support.Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block.In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software.Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits.In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    isconsidered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade.The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs.Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments.The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others.In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a
  link to additional photos. Please feel free to have a glimpse at the
  amazing life Victor has lived, and is living.We, Victor's friends and family, thank you!","30,754",,https://fundrazr.com/fundvictor,Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,148,"Jul 21, 2018",

"My name is Maria del Rocio Garcia, and I have setup this Fundrazer
  page for my S/O (Significant Other/Fiance) Thomas Ernst.He was
  hospitalized with a aggressive tissue decaying infection in his left
  leg below the knee December 2016 with the initial diagnoses by several
  doctors to amputate the leg above the knee.Dr. Mar Chavira at
  Salvatierra hospital in La Paz did not share that opinion and
  initiated treatment and procedures to rescue the limb and avoid an
  pending amputation.The goal of this fundraising..if met...would
  cover our medical expenses incurred so far (+/-9,500,-US $) as well
  the cost of living / debt accumulated during the time of the illness
  and recovery without any income and would supply the funding required
  to find another rental moving to a better location with option to work
  for him (+/- 5500,-US $) Please read explanation in details further
  down and in theblogwe have started.Basically we are not capable on our own power to leave the
  sub-average lifestyle zone we are in right now and funding would
  provide a huge help to Thomas Ernst and me assisting to restart our
  life to a ""normal"", simple lifestyle level again.This
  is basically ""our story"" in a nutshell.Please read in
  detail below and may consider making a donation to allow T.E. to get
  back to work, to manage the significant debt accumulated from his
  battle with the infection.A donation of any kind will be greatly
  appreciated and would be a huge help. Also, please feel free to
  forward on the link to anyone you think might be interested in
  supporting the cause.Pleaseuse this contact formIf you have
  any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of
  this effort to help Thomas Ernst and
  me.---------------------------------------------------We
  do not have a professional background to create such fundraiser pages
  as this here in the proper way and writing.My English also has
  severe flaws and I apologize for that.It is work in progress as
  we been forced to change the fundraiser platform due to the
  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe
  and by their policy is Mexico aNon-GoFundMe supported Country
    and they will shut down. You find info on thishereYou can see screenshots of received donations during the past 2
  weekshere on our blog.The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at theBaja Nomads forumand made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space.Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!!Album - Gallery until August 2017here on Google documents.We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.

  manager and surgical technician.  This beautiful young couple
  purchased a home together and had big plans for their new life
  together.....that all changed in an instant on April 14th when they
  were involved in a devastating automobile accident.Brad and Jessica were on their way back to Maryland from Ohio when a
  semi truck and trailer ran a stop sign causing Brad and Jessica's SUV
  to TBone the trailer head on. They were pinned under a trailer 
  carrying steel beams for over an hour until first responders could
  extract them.  The pictures are horrific and hard to look at it.  But
  it's the only way to see how truly lucky they were.It is a miracle they survived such a violent accident and their road
  to recovery is a long one...but at least they have a road.  Everyone
  who knows them feel truly blessed that somehow their lives were spared.Brad, an active outgoing young man,  suffered multiple compound
  fractures in both arms, shattered elbow, a fractured foot,  a severe
  concussion, multiple deep facial lacerations and almost every bone in
  his face is fractured.  He has already endured 2 extensive surgeries
  and more are scheduled. He will need facial reconstruction surgeries. 
  Jessica, can only be described as someone who can light up the darkest
  day has a fractured vertebrate, fractured cheek, multiple lacerations
  and head trauma.  She is improving every day but has a long ways to go.This fundraiser is set up to raise funds to help Brad and Jessica
  with their expenses during their long road to recovery.  Brad and
  Jessica's  severe and incapacitating injuries will prevent them from
  returning back to work anytime in the foreseeable future.  They both
  will have to extensive rehab and therapy.Our goal is to raise enough funds to cover their mortgage payment,
  living expenses and assistance for the next 12 months.  We want Brad
  and Jessica to only concentrate on their recovery and not worry about
  how they will pay their bills or if they will lose their home.  Any
  funds leftover will go towards medical, rehabilitation and physical
  therapy bills that are growing at an alarming rate.We are also planning a live fundraiser at a date to be determined to
  help us reach our goal.Please consider donating today.  Please share with family and friends!.....and please count your blessings and be thankful for every happy

"Smart, beautiful, loving, and caring. This is Marius!Since the age of 18, Marius was passionate about school, especially
  math and economics, going to school was the one thing he really wanted
  to do. Marius was so committed to his goals that he worked every day
  to earn the money he needed to go to college; he was determined not to
  just go to school, but to earn a Master’s degree in accounting. When
  he was done with school he planned on opening up an accounting office.Marius’s dream came to a screeching halt in 2016 when he was
  diagnosed with a serious illness. He suddenly found himself at the
  mercy of the medical establishment and as found that his employer
  would not accommodate the time Marius needed off from work to get
  treatment, so he lost his job.Even with this, Marius was not a quitter; his finals for his Master’s
  degree were right around the corner. Even though Marius felt dejected
  and his health was failing he finished his degree with honors.After completing his degree, and with renewed hope Marius set out to
  fight the illness that was ravaging his body, just like he had set out
  to go to school and get his degree. As he saw various doctors, it
  became clear that the prognosis was not good and that he needed to
  have surgery to stop the spread of the disease, which now had a name,
  cancer. Though Marius had never smoked and was not a drinker, he had
  Oral Cancer and only a radical surgery could save him.People often believe that you can’t get Oral Cancer unless you smoke,
  chew tobacco, drink excessively or have other lifestyle risk factors,
  but the American Cancer Society says 35% of the people who get this
  type of cancer have no risk factors.That means of the 100,000 people who get Oral Cancer every year, many
  never even imagined they could get the disease, because they weren’t
  doing any of the things they believe cause cancer. Men are also
  disproportionately affected by oral cancer with twice the risk for the
  disfiguring disease as women.Cancer is such a pervasive disease that almost everyone knows someone
  who has faced the disease. Our campaign“Save a Life Today -
    Marius Needs A Hero”is raising money needed to halt the
  rapid advance of cancer.One of the battles patients face with this cancer is that insurance
  does not always cover all of the surgery. Marius is facing this
  situation and as a young recent college graduate, with no income, he
  has to find a way to pay for his treatment. Already he has sought out
  every option for free treatment, but he has not found a program he
  qualifies for. In fact most options require him to be in the final
  stages of cancer where death is imminent to get help.The money that we hope to raise will cover the entire costs of
    surgery and treatment plan. This treatment plan includes full
    surgical removal of the cancerous cells and will also remove all of
    Marius’s teeth. Then, the reconstruction of Marius’s mouth and face,
    including implanting 14 teeth. Completing this surgery quickly will
    mean that Marius can avoid radiation and chemo therapy.If you ever wanted to be someone’s hero, YOU CAN, right now for
  Marius!  Instead of making a donation to a large organization where
  you hope it will help someone, you will be able to see the progress
  Marius makes as see how much of an impact your donation makes. You
  will be able to have a direct and positive impact on Marius’s life and

"Tiffany Johnson (our beloved Psychic Tiff) suffered a stroke on Friday afternoon January 18th, 2013.  She was immediately rushed to the hospital where CT and MRI confirmed our worst fears; it was a massive Arterial Dissection.Arterial dissection refers to the abnormal formation of a tear along the inside wall of an artery. As the tear becomes larger, it forms a small pouch which doctors call a “false lumen.”Blood pools inside the wall of the artery until it begins to impede blood flow. The blood inside the false lumen can clot and extend slowly into the area where blood normally flows. This can limit or completely interrupt blood flow to a part of the brain. Small pieces from the growing blood clot can break off, flow upstream, and become trapped inside a smaller artery in the brain.Tiffany underwent a 5 hour surgery to save her life. She was then taken to ICU where we prayed the worst might be over and recovery could begin. Within 24 hours her brain swelling became so severe a second operation was required to once again save her life.  A portion of her skull had to be removed in order to make room for the brain to swell without doing further damage.The prognosis at this point was grim, the family was told that she may not survive, but we all had hope.  Tiffany just turned 40 years old is in peak physical condition, if anyone had a shot at beating this, it was her.CT scans we're performed every 24 hours and a team of doctors, surgeons and nurses monitored her 24/7.Tiffany was giving us small signs that she was fighting and seemed to understand what was happening.   Within a few hours of her second surgery she actually gave us the ""thumbs up"" – our hope and optimism soared.She spent several days in ICU hooked up to various machines and was being administered powerful medications.  She was then moved to progressive care where she spent several more days under 24 hour care.  She was far from out of the woods at this point but remained stable and was continuing to fight.Tiffany stabilized enough to be moved to a standard care room where she spent several, more days.  She was heavily sedated and unable to communicate, but as the fog began to lift the doctors we’re able to determine the extent of her injuries, and the news was saddening.  About 2/3 of the right brain hemisphere had died due to lack of oxygen.  She was paralyzed on her left side and had no feeling in or use of her left arm and left leg.  Her speech was almost non existent and there appeared to be serious vision problems.  We were told some of these symptoms might improve once the brain swelling stopped and began to subside.After 6.5 days of being virtually comatose Tiffany opened her eyes and was able to mouth a few words.  She still had use of her right arm and leg and was able to point out her needs and areas of pain.  It was at this point we finally received some positive news, Tiffany was able to swallow.  Had she lost this function her future would have taken a very different direction.  We began to feed her spoonfuls of juice and her favorite, ice chips. With each passing day she was able to speak a few more words and we were thrilled to realize that she knew what month and year it was, she knew her birth date, her husbands name and more.  Tiffany was still there but trapped in a body she no longer had control over.  On Day 12 Tiffany was transferred to the Rehabilitation Center in the hospital where she will remain indefinitely.Tiffany’s story remains unwritten but we believe she was chosen for a very specific reason.  Many believe Tiffany is a living breathing angel of God.  During her career as a Psychic, Author, Speaker and Healer she has affected thousands of people in a very positive way.  She has changed lives for the better and the world is a better place because she is in it.  She has brought inspiration and hope to so many but we believe her story of recovery will be the most inspiration gift of all.  Tiffany will shine & sparkle once again, but the journey will be long and difficult.Its clear Tiffany’s future is forever changed.  If she is able to return home someday she will require 24/7 nursing care for several months.  Her home will need to be modified to accommodate her disabilities.  Special equipment, beds and safety features will be required.  God willing she is able to drive a car again she will need a special vehicle with handicap capabilities.  There will be countless doctor visits, ongoing physical, occupational and speech therapies along with various medications to give her the best shot at a full life. Tiffany was also self employed and will no longer be able to run her business for an indefinite amount of time.Tiffany has got this far due to her strength and her will to survive.  The overwhelming support has given Tiffany and her family optimism and strength but the journey is far from over.Please support and donate to Tiffany's recovery.","18,060",,https://fundrazr.com/3QfEf,Tiffany Smith Johnson Stroke Fund,,,

  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color accuracy.My name is Joe, I'm ex-military, I'm a student working towards
  being a motorcycle mechanic, and I have color-blindness.  Growing up I
  always had issues with certain colors, purple was a big one.  When I
  joined the Coast Guard they diagnosed me with color vision deficiency
  in my medical screening which severely limited my job selection. 
  While I was enlisted I found many scenarios where I simply could not
  perform a task due to being unable to detect a color; i found out
  ships have red and green colored running lights so you could tell
  their heading at a distance at night, I just thought they were white
  lights.  In my new chosen career field im facing new challenges that
  stem from this issue: in our modern age motorcycles are increasingly
  complex, with more and more wires as more things become controlled by
  onboard computers, all color coded and many with slim 'tracer' lines
  in a different color that are very difficult to see in low light or
  even with flashlights.  If a wiring diagram tells me im looking for a
  certain color wire and i cant pick it out of the mess of wires i cant
  do a repair, which is a very costly delay in a job where any wasted
  time comes right out of your pocket.With a pair of Enchroma glasses I could finally be on a more level
  playing field for a job I've dreamed of having for years, and finally
  have a chance at doing.  Below is some information on Enchroma
  glasses, and I hope that after reading this you'll find it in your
  heart to help me.  Thank you.Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not a

He has always talked about finding a way to allow him to see the beauty in the every day world and I think I have found a solution~ Enchroma Glasses!

You see, he is an incredibly hard working man who is always working to provide for our family. He deserves this so much and it breaks my heart to see him get frustrated when someone asks him to retrieve an item of certain color and he struggles to find it. Recently, we had a gender reveal for our son who is coming into this world sometime during September 2018. We had a balloon filled with blue confetti, and when the balloon popped Austin thought the confetti was pink until I whispered in his ear that he was indeed getting his baby boy.

"MY COLORBLIND STORYMy kindergarten teacher used flash cards to teach us the colors,
  numbers, and letters. I learned the letters and numbers quickly, but I
  had a lot of difficulty learning the colors. I didn't understand why
  something that came so easy to the other kids was so difficult for me.
  My teacher noticed my frustration and pulled me aside to teach me the
  colors one-on-one. She noticed that I was getting a lot of the colors
  right but there were a few that I would mix up: green and brown, blue
  and purple, orange and red. She quickly concluded that I must be
  colorblind. She told me that it's okay that I was getting some colors
  wrong because there were some colors my eyes just couldn't see.It
    wasn’t my fault.She let my parents know her discovery and my
  mom said that her father is colorblind and so I must have gotten it
  from him.Luckily for me, my colorblindness is not very severe. I grew up and
  went through school like a normal kid.Sometimes I would use the
    wrong colors and draw a tree with brown leaves and a green
  trunk, but usually I did a good job of asking a friend or a
  teacher what color something was if I wasn’t sure. To this day I pick
  colors based on their names or RGB codes instead of how they “look”
  since I can’t trust my eyes to tell me the right thing.In high school I took a color vision test online. Color vision tests
  consist of a bunch of dots on a screen where certain letters or
  numbers are visible or invisible depending on what type of color
  vision you have. Based on what things I could and could not identify
  in each image, the test concluded that I havedeuteranomaly,
  meaning that I can see green but not very well. Basically I can see
  100% of blues, 50% of reds, and 25% of greens.I would like to get Enchroma color vision corrective glasses so that
  I can see greens and reds better. I would love to see how vivid green
  grass really is. I would love to see the deep red color of heart

    Aquino, or Lheng (as she is called at home & by her
    close friends), or ""Mama Cel"" to most... a term of
    endearment which she earned while working as a registered nursein the Philippines & in Norway.""Nurse/ Mama Cel"", 41 years young, has been diagnosed
    with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.We are knocking on your good hearts to help aHEROin her battle. As a nurse, she took care of
    people, nursed them back to health, and even held their hands at the
    last moments of their life. Now, it is time we give back the love
    & care that our hero has unselfishly given to society.We are raising funds for her treatment and palliative care.Mama Cel has battled the Big C in several rounds for almost 2
    decades, and won.In 2006, she had mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation toWIN vs Breast Cancer Stage 3B.In 2014, she had a big mass on her right chest (fist-size of
    male adult) which was surgically removed and wasBENIGN.In 2015, she had a little lump on her left breast, was operated
    and it wasBENIGN.Last Oct 2017, Mama Cel was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage 4.
    She took oral chemo meds, and went back to Norway, Dec 2017 &
    continued her oral chemo there.Feb 7, 2018 Mama Cel got her biopsy results:TRIPLE NEGATIVE
    DISEASE.In layman's term: MALIGNANT. :(She started having persistent lumbar pain and last March 2018,1 Liter of fluid was drained, after she rushed herself to the ER
    in Norway due to difficulty of breathing. She lived there alone (but
    with a few neighbouring good friends who have been her
    ""angels"" as well), & was already having a difficult
    time sleeping & moving around.Hence, the big decision to go back home. Even if the health care
    in Norway is free, it doesn't cover alternative medicine (Mama Cel
    is firm on not having IV chemo; and that was the only option offered
    there, and at an experimental stage at that); and no friends
    can replace the presence of family.This condition has deteriorated her quality of life: Pain Scale
    10/10, weight loss, difficulty in breathing.On May 2018, she was confined for 10 days at the PGH (Philippine
    General Hospital) due to pleural effusion: 3 liters of fluid had to
    be drained via chest tube and pleurodesis done after.The cost of procedures, hospitalization expenses, palliative
    care and rounds of integrative treatment are exhausting Nurse Mama

"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss.But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles!Let me
  tell you the rest of our story.Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age.At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her.But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl.For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength!This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible.Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it.This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000.Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah","2,959",,https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes,Hannah's Heroes,67,,

  2 when I was 16 years old with hearing and vision damaged. It causes
  tumours to grow anywhere in my brain, along with the spinal cords and
  peripheral nerves. So far I have had 20 different surgeries to safely
  remove the tumours whenever needed to preserve my life.In the end of 2017, I need to undergo surgery again to remove
  multiple large tumours called schwannoma from both my arms. They have
  made my fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms.I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I lose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared

  to adapt by getting help from people to do my work and in order to

"HOW IT ALL STARTED AND THE CANCER DIAGNOSISMy husband, Poh Teik “Jack” Teoh, age 63, was diagnosed with
    Stage 4 skin cancer in September 2017.  The cancer has spread to his
    spine and ribs and has severely weakened his body in ways that are
    distressing and heart-breaking for us both.The cancer started out as a very small growth on Jack’s right
    ear. It was initially diagnosed as a fungus infection and treated
    successfully with anti-fungal medication in the USA in the spring of
    2015.  In November of 2015, with great health and high expectations,
    we decided to follow our ultimate dream and set-up an import/export
    business in Penang, Malaysia; my husband’s birthplace.In Malaysia, the growth on Jack’s ear
    gradually came back so we sought medical help. The first doctor
    diagnosed the growth as cancerous. He recommended amputating the
    whole ear and scraping off the brain tissue surrounding the ear
    followed by plastic surgery to make a new ear.  We immediately
    sought a second opinion as the growth was very small. To us and many
    others this surgical solution was too severe and Jack’s overall
    health was excellent. The second doctor recommended a series of
    stronger medications including chemo pills. We followed this
    treatment and managed to keep the growth under control. We expected
    the growth would vanish just as it did in the USAIn early 2017 my husband started to
    feel weak off and on with intermittent and sometimes indescribable
    pain. Jack managed to control the pain with prescribed medication
    and his own sheer will. We continued to work very hard at full speed
    to launch our import business, putting in our best effort with full
    enthusiasm to make our dreams come true.  Then in August, Jack
    suddenly became extremely weak, he lost his appetite completely and
    the growth started to spread at an alarming rate.   That’s when I
    admitted Jack into Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital here in Penang,
    Malaysia; an excellent hospital with a phenomenal medical staff. I
    moved into Jack’s hospital room the day he was admitted and have not
    left his side since.For the full medical diagnosis see the letter written by
      Jack’s doctor (Dr. Ho) below:THE REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF THE COME-BACK KID – THE FIRST 2
      MONTHS AT MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITALDue to the excellent care at Mount Miriam Cancer
    Hospital, in addition to Jack’s inimitable strength and fighting
    spirit, Jack has been able to consistently beat all odds and triumph
    over some very serious health issues. In early September, a few days
    after his first chemo infusion, he suffered a heart attack.
    Amazingly, Jack recovered and prevailed with willingness and
    strength. Just three weeks after his heart attack, Jack decided to
    continue the chemo (in a more gentler form) to resume his fight
    against his cancer.Due to a rapid loss of muscle mass and strength since August,
    Jack no longer has the strength to stand up on his own. He can only
    walk a short distance in our hospital room with a walker and the
    assistance of a therapist.  My husband is bound to the bed most of
    the time. He barely has enough strength to practice learning how to
    walk again.  But despite the severity of Jack’s condition, and the
    utter frustration he endures, he never fails to inspire others, make
    the doctors and nurses smile as they admire his remarkable strength
    and positivity.After the 4th chemo infusion on October 25th, Jack developed
    an infection that hit him fast and fierce. His oxygen levels dropped
    dramatically and he had extreme difficulty breathing. He was headed
    for the Intensive Care Unit at another hospital but thankfully the
    medical staff at Mount Miriam got the infection under control
    quickly and stabilized Jack beautifully.  Jack took a brief break
    from the chemo and agreed to resume the treatments on November 10th.
    As Jack said: “there is more positive than negative” and he chooses
    to continue what’s working for him and face every battle head-on.Dr. Ho & JackMedical AttentionELLEN & JACK: MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVERBorn in the USA, I grew up Mountain
    Lakes, New Jersey and my husband Jack is from Malaysia.  We met in
    New Jersey in 2003 when Jack was living and working in New York. 
    From the very first day I met Jack he was always robust and full of
    life. He woke up every morning like it was Christmas, just like a
    child.  Jack is like a magnet, he’s irresistible, pulling people in
    with his charisma and zany sense of humour.  But what stole my heart
    is his heart. I have never met a person as self-less as my husband.
    He is someone I can trust with all my heart to do the right thing
    for anyone in any situation. Jack is a leader with a big heart; some
    would say a true warrior.  It’s absolutely heart-wrenching for me to
    see my husband suffer and become so weak and frail in such a short
    period of time.  He has spent a lifetime generously helping others
    and now is in great need himself.  I ask you to please help me help
    my husband, so he can beat this cancer and we can continue our lives
    as one.  This journey of recovery and healing will take time, but we
    both have a deep, enduring faith that we will prevail with the
    continuation of the excellent medical care at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital.Jack and me 2005HELP NEEDED WITH MEDICAL EXPENSESMonthly Medical Expenses at Mount
    Miriam Cancer Hospital Averages $7205.50 USDDue to the onset of Jack’s illness,
    the launching of our business was cut short, so we are not
    generating any income.  Due to my husband’s fragile and
    unpredictable condition, I am with him around the clock to make sure
    his special and urgent needs are met. Jack is not in an intensive
    care unit, but still requires my watchful presence so if/when and
    emergency arises he gets immediate medical attention.  Sometimes
    it's a matter of seconds that will determine someone's fate as it
    was when I alerted the medical staff of his extraordinary high fever
    and severe difficulty in breathing.With neither one of us working,
    continuing to pay for Jack’s medical expenses and our basic but
    essential living expenses is an impossibility without the help of
    others. Not until Jack is stable enough for me to leave his side can
    I resume the full-time re-launch of our import business.Not having medical insurance, we have
    received some financial help from the hospital’s social welfare
    department. However, it’s not enough and I am not sure if it will
    continue. Witnessing my husband go through periods of anguish and
    taking care of him can be very stressful and exhausting. With your
    kind consideration and help, our financial stress can be alleviated.
    Your generosity would allow me to brave this journey with less
    pressure and more strength to support my husband with his medical
    and personal needs. Your financial help, and the spreading of my
    campaign on your social network, will be forever appreciated because
    I simply cannot do this alone.  Thank you ever so much.It’s very difficult to determine when
    Jack will be discharged and continue his treatments as an
    out-patient either from home or a step-down facility.  Just when it
    looks like a discharge is nearing, he has another set-back that
    requires intensive hospital care.  With more chemo on the way, I
    just don’t know what to expect and how his body will respond. We
    take it week by week, day by day.Jack started a 12-week course of chemo on September 29th.
    After he finished his 4th infusion on October 20th he had a set-back
    due to a serious infection but resumed his infusions on November
    10th. He recently finished his 6th chemo but is taking a break to
    garner some strength and a better appetite before he does the 7th
    chemo.  After this 12-week course is finished, there will be a
    reassessment and break before the next chemo course starts.  Then,
    after 6 months of chemo infusions there will be another reassessment
    to determine the next phase of treatment, which may include radiation.At this point in time, it’s impossible to determine our
    medical and living expenses after discharge. It all depends on how
    stable and self-sufficient Jack is at that time. I do know that it
    will take some time, months, for him to regain the strength
    necessary to walk on his own again.  If Jack is not re-admitted into
    the hospital, we will be looking at the following expenses.This is the best approximation I can give at this time:MEDICAL EXPENSES AFTER DISCHARGE FROM MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITALLive-in, Step-down Facility with Medical Care and Physical
    Therapy:   $1,125.00 USD per month(a step-down facility if
  necessary, or Jack can do his out-patient from home)Basic Medical Supplies Needed at Home:  $436.00 USD
  min(wheelchair, walker, commode, air cushion mattress)Monthly Physical Therapy & Visiting Nurse at Home: 
    $705.00 USDMonthly Out-Patient Expenses at Mount Miriam Hospital:approximate range of $1,143.00 to $2,755.00
  USD(doctor appointments, blood tests, chemo infusions,
  blood transfusions, ear dressings, medications)10 Course Treatment of Radiation:  $2,000 USDWhen a donation is made, the money will be accepted by PayPal
    and then deposited into my USA bank checking account.  With my USA
    checking account debit card, I can pay for Jack’s medical expenses
    here at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital.  From my Malaysian bank, I can
    also withdraw cash (in the form of Malaysian Ringgits) from my USA
    checking account and this will help me with our essential living
    expenses (apartment rent, utilities, food and transportation).The following fees are deducted from each donation (USA &
    Canada):Fundrazr : 5%PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30Total

    greatly appreciate your help in sharing my campaign.  I just do not
    know what lies ahead in medical expenses, it’s very hard to predict.
    The hospital has been understanding of my financial situation but
    does expect a significant payment every 2 to 3 weeks.I greatly appreciate your kind consideration in supporting me
    & donating to the best of your ability in this critical
